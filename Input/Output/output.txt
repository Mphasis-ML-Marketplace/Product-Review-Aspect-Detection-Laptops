{'review': "The screen doesn't lift keyboard Build & Looks are awesome. Performance is just awesome, Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down Apps opens in no time Gestures works perfectly All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram & 512 NvMe SSD. Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure. Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push & pull out and battery life is low",
